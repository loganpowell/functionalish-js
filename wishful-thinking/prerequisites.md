# Setup

## Prerequisits

### Terminal

#### Windows Users

- Cmder w/Bash

#### Mac Users

- Hyper

### IDE

This is where we'll write our code. We will be using VSCode

- VSCode
  - my font: Fira Code (w/ligatures enabled in VSCode "settings")
  - my syntax highlighter: Carbonnight (allows us to focus on errors and syntax without the noise of color, for which the rules of are more confusing than they're worth for understanding the code)

### Linting / Formatting

This helps with finding pesky bugs in our code for us. It's free help. Always accept help when you need it, especially if it's free.

- ESLint
- Prettier

## Out of Scope

Though these are not critical for your functional-programming learning path, they are handy in a professional environment and also helpful when working with others

- Git
- Google
  - Also known as "Google Fu": your ability to find answers to questions you may not exactly know the wording for. I.e., the ability to find things without knowing exactly what they're called.
  - Some tips:
    - `"exact match"`: quoted words/phrases -> when you know exactly what to look for (e.g., for error messages)
    - `site: stackoverflow.com`: search a specific site -> when you don't know the exact words and limiting to certain sites helps filter out the noise (e.g., `site: developer.mozilla.org`)
  - Those two are the ones I used the most in my learning path, but there are [many more](https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/)
- Markdown
