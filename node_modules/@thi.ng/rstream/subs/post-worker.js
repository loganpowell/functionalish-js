/**
 * Creates a {@link ISubscriber | subscriber} which forwards received
 * values to given worker.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The `worker` can be an existing `Worker` instance, a JS source code
 * `Blob` or an URL string. In the latter two cases, a worker is created
 * automatically. If `transfer` is true, the received values will be
 * marked as *transferrable* and the host app loses all access
 * permissions to these marked values. See `Worker.postMessage()` for
 * details.
 *
 * If `terminate` is set to a positive number, then the worker will be
 * automatically terminated after the stated number of milliseconds
 * since the parent subscription is {@link ISubscriber.done}.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // worker source code
 * src = `self.onmessage = (e) => console.log("worker", e.data);`;
 *
 * a = stream();
 * a.subscribe(
 *   postWorker(src, { type: "application/javascript" }))
 * );
 *
 * a.next(42)
 * // worker 42
 * ```
 *
 * @param worker -
 * @param transfer -
 * @param terminate - worker termination delay (ms)
