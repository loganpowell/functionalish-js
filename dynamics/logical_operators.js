/*
In functional programming, data is always preferable to - and more transparent than - functions of the same "strength". I.e., if you can do a job without a function and only use data, that is preferred as data is more universal than functions (data transcends language)

Likewise, if you can get away with a function expression, when you might use a function statement - as long as it's not too convoluted - an expression is better as it is closer to data than a statement
