// destructuring & aliases
// destructuring is using array or object literal syntax on the LHS (left-hand side) of a variable assignment. I.e., anywhere you would normally assign a single variable `name`, you can also "reach into" the data structure of the array or object to "pull out" to their entries by index/position - in the case of arrays - or by key - in the case of objects. This applies  for general var/let/const assignments as well as function parameter assignments (which are - under the hood - actually [scoped] variable assignments as well).
